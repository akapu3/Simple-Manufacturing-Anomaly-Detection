Predictive Maintenance: Machine Failure Prediction
üåü Overview
This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning for predictive maintenance in a manufacturing setting. The goal is to predict potential machine failures based on various sensor readings and operational parameters, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing unexpected downtime. This showcases skills in AI model development, data analysis, and handling real-world industrial data.

üéØ Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate a classification model capable of identifying whether a machine is likely to experience a failure at a given point in time. Special emphasis is placed on effectively handling imbalanced datasets, which are common in anomaly detection scenarios where failures are rare events.

üóÑÔ∏è Dataset
The project utilizes the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset, a synthetic dataset designed to reflect real predictive maintenance data encountered in the industry. It comprises 10,000 data points with 14 features, including:

Identifiers: UDI, Product ID

Categorical: Type (Product quality variant: L, M, H)

Sensor Readings/Operational Parameters: Air temperature [K], Process temperature [K], Rotational speed [rpm], Torque [Nm], Tool wear [min]

Failure Modes (Individual flags): TWF (Tool Wear Failure), HDF (Heat Dissipation Failure), PWF (Power Failure), OSF (Overstrain Failure), RNF (Random Failures)

Target Variable: Machine failure (1 if any failure mode is active, 0 otherwise)

The dataset exhibits a significant class imbalance, with machine failures (positive class) being a minority. This is a crucial aspect addressed during model evaluation.


üìà Results & Discussion
The classification_report and confusion_matrix provide detailed insights into the model's performance. For the Machine failure class (class 1), a high recall value indicates that the model is effective at identifying most of the actual machine failures, which is vital to prevent unexpected downtime. The precision for class 1 shows how reliable the positive predictions are, minimizing false alarms. The F1-score offers a balanced measure of both.

The imbalance in the dataset means that even a moderate recall for the minority class is a strong indicator of a useful model, given how few actual failures there are. The overall accuracy might be high due to the dominance of the 'no failure' class, but the focused metrics for class 1 are more meaningful.

üîö Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning solution for predictive maintenance using a real-world inspired dataset. By leveraging techniques like one-hot encoding and evaluating with metrics appropriate for imbalanced data, the developed model provides valuable insights into machine health and failure prediction. This project directly aligns with the requirements of an AI Engineer role, showcasing practical machine learning application and data analysis skills.

‚û°Ô∏è Future Work
Hyperparameter Tuning: Further optimize the Random Forest model's performance by tuning its hyperparameters (e.g., n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split) using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

Advanced Imbalance Handling: Explore more sophisticated techniques for imbalanced datasets, such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to oversample the minority class, or using algorithms specifically designed for imbalanced learning.

Different Models: Experiment with other classification algorithms like Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM) or neural networks to compare performance.

Feature Importance: Analyze feature importance from the Random Forest model to understand which sensor readings are most critical for predicting failures.

Time-Series Analysis: While this project treats each data point independently, a real-world scenario often involves sequential sensor data. Integrating time-series analysis (e.g., using LSTMs or other sequence models) could provide even more robust predictions.

Deployment: Containerize the model using Docker and create a simple API (e.g., with Flask) to demonstrate potential deployment.
